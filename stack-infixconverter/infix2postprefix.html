    <h1>Infix to Postfix/Prefix calculator</h1>
    <p>About each notation: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Infix: This is the standard notation we use in everyday mathematics. <br>

            Operators are placed between operands. <br>
            Example: a + b * c <br>

            Characteristics:
            <ul>
                <li>Most intuitive for humans to read and write</li>
                <li>Requires parentheses to clarify order of operations</li>
                <li>Needs additional parsing for computer evaluation</li>
                
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Postfix: Also known as Reverse Polish Notation (RPN). <br>

            Operators follow their operands. <br>
            Example: a b c * + <br>
        
            Characteristics:
            <ul>
                <li>Eliminates the need for parentheses</li>
                <li>Easier for computers to parse and evaluate</li>
                <li>Used in some calculators and programming languages</li>
                <li>Evaluation can be done using a stack</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        
        <li>Prefix: Also known as Polish Notation. <br>
        
            Operators precede their operands. <br>
            Example: + a * b c <br>
        
            Characteristics:
            <ul>
                <li>Also eliminates the need for parentheses</li>
                <li>Clear indication of operator precedence</li>
                <li>Less common than postfix, but used in some programming languages (like Lisp)</li>
                <li>Can be evaluated using recursion or a stack</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        
    </ol>
