    <h1>Welcome to my project.</h1>
    <h2>
    This project will help you learn about Stack basics
    Also a bonus, you can convert infix equations to postfix and prefix and vice versa.
    This will also act as other conversion tools as well in future and be a strong converter.
    I have thought of making this project in Python, but I might create in Java if needed.</h2>


    <h3>here are the links to following converters:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="./infix2postprefix.html">Infix to Postfix and Prefix</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Postfix to Infix</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Prefix to Infix</a></li>
        
    </ul>
